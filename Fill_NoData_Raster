# MEAN—The mean (average value) of the cells in the neighborhood will be calculated.
# MAJORITY—The majority (value that occurs most often) of the cells in the neighborhood will be identified.
# MAXIMUM—The maximum (largest value) of the cells in the neighborhood will be identified.
# MEDIAN—The median of the cells in the neighborhood will be calculated. Median is equivalent to the 50th percentile.
# MINIMUM—The minimum (smallest value) of the cells in the neighborhood will be identified.
# MINORITY—The minority (value that occurs least often) of the cells in the neighborhood will be identified.
# PERCENTILE—A percentile of the cells in the neighborhood will be calculated. The 90th percentile is calculated by default. You can specify other values (from 0 to 100) using the percentile_value parameter.
# RANGE—The range (difference between largest and smallest value) of the cells in the neighborhood will be calculated.
# STD—The standard deviation of the cells in the neighborhood will be calculated.
# SUM—The sum of the cells in the neighborhood will be calculated.
# VARIETY—The variety (the number of unique values) of the cells in the neighborhood will be calculated.
